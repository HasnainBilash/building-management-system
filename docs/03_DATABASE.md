# Database

Provider

PostgreSQL

ORM

Prisma ORM

The database is designed around one central idea:

```

Landlord

↓

Building

↓

Floor

↓

Flat

↓

Tenant

↓

Lease

↓

Rent & Utility Bills

↓

Payments

```

Every model fits naturally into this hierarchy.

---

# Current Models

Every model below exists in the Prisma schema. Application-layer status
(Server Actions, routes, components) varies by model — see
`00_PROJECT_MEMORY.md` → Current Features for what's actually wired up.

```

# Soft Deletes

# Indexes

Indexes are used throughout the schema to improve query performance.

Examples

- email
- ownerId
- buildingId
- floorId
- leaseId
- status
- createdAt

Future indexes should be added only when necessary.

---

# Database Principles

The schema follows these principles.

- Normalize data.
- Avoid duplication.
- Use relations instead of repeated fields.
- Use enums instead of strings.
- Index frequently queried columns.
- Use soft deletes where appropriate.

---

# Future Database Changes

Whenever a new model is introduced

Update this document.

Whenever a relation changes

Update this document.

Whenever an enum changes

Update this document.

Whenever Prisma schema changes

Run

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Then update this documentation.

This document should always match `prisma/schema.prisma`.
