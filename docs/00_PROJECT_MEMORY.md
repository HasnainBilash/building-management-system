# Project Vision

Build a modern, scalable, production-ready Building Management System that allows landlords to manage residential properties from a single dashboard while providing tenants with a structured and secure workflow.

The project should prioritize:

- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Readability
- Simplicity
- Long-term consistency

Production-quality architecture is always preferred over shortcuts.

---

# Project Philosophy

This project intentionally spends more time designing architecture so future development becomes easier.

Whenever information is missing:

> ASK.

Never guess.

Never silently redesign architecture.

Never rewrite working code unless there is a valid architectural reason.

---

# Technology Stack

## Frontend

- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4

## Backend

- Server Actions

## Authentication

- Auth.js v5
- Credentials Provider
- JWT Strategy
- bcrypt

## Database

- PostgreSQL
- Prisma ORM

## Validation

- Zod

---

# Architecture Summary

The project follows a layered architecture.

```
Browser

↓

App Router

↓

React Components

↓

Server Actions

↓

Prisma ORM

↓

PostgreSQL
```

Business logic belongs inside Server Actions.

Validation belongs inside Zod.

Database access belongs inside Prisma.

UI components should never contain business logic.

Architecture v2.0 is considered frozen unless intentionally revised.

- User Login
- Password Hashing
- JWT Authentication
- Session Management
- Protected Routes
- Route Protection
- Credentials Provider
- Zod Validation

### Dashboard

- Dashboard Layout

- User Navigation

### Building Module

- Create Building

- Zod Validation

### Floors Module

- Create Floor
- Bulk Create Floors

- Floor Ordering
- Floor Statistics
- Reusable Floor Form
- Server Actions
- Prisma Integration
- Zod Validation
- Breadcrumb Navigation
- Back Navigation

### Flats Module

- Create Flat
- Bulk Create Flats

### Quick Setup

- Auto-generates a range of Floors and, per Floor, a range of Flats in a
  single transaction
- Flats numbered Floor × 100 + unit (e.g. Floor 3 → 301, 302...)
- Duplicate-safe: existing Floors/Flats are left untouched, gaps are filled
- Capped at 100 floors / 500 total flats per run
- Lives under `src/actions/quick-setup/`, since it spans Building, Floor,
  and Flat rather than belonging to a single entity

# Development Principles

The project follows these principles.

- TypeScript everywhere
- Prisma for database access
- Auth.js for authentication
- Zod for validation
- Server Actions for internal CRUD
- API Routes only when required by external libraries or integrations
- Reusable UI components
- No duplicated business logic
- Soft Delete over hard delete where appropriate
- Ownership validation for protected resources

# Development Workflow

Every feature follows the same workflow.

1. Design
2. Discuss architecture
3. Implement
4. Test
5. Refactor
6. Update documentation
7. Commit

Documentation is considered part of the implementation.

---

# Working Agreement

Whenever ChatGPT is uncertain about

- project structure
- implementation
- architecture
- existing code

it should request the relevant file instead of making assumptions.

Correctness is preferred over speed.

---

# Next Goal

Implement Tenant Profiles following the established architecture.

Future modules should reuse the same architecture and development patterns introduced by the Building, Floors, and Flats Modules — including baking in breadcrumb and back navigation from the start, rather than retrofitting it afterward.

---

# Long-Term Goal

Develop a complete production-ready Building Management System while maintaining a clean, scalable, and consistent architecture across every module.

This document should always represent the current state of the repository.
