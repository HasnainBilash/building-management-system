# Development Workflow

1. Plan the feature.
2. Implement the feature.
3. Test the feature.
4. Refactor if necessary.
5. Update documentation.
6. Commit changes.

A feature is **not considered complete** until its documentation has been updated.

# Philosophy

The documentation exists so that no developer—including future versions of ourselves—has to guess how the project works.

Whenever information is missing:

**Ask. Never guess.**
